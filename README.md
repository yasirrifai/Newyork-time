## By scrolling down we can go throught the best selling book list.

By using **hover effects** a particular book can be highlighted whis is also shown in the below by hovering a light grey color to indicate that the user has the mouse pointer over the relevant book

### Using a button beneath the image to proceed to purchase from Amazon.



*I have used a **hover effect** on the button so that it would give you a mild green color and a cursor pointer when your are above to click on the button or when you move your mouse pointer  over it*

In the button function **i have merged the URL** for the proceedings to the Amozon page so that once you click on the the button, there will be a window popped up which directs you to the amozon page to view more details and to purchase it.
